## Skins
* ### Guitar Hero 5 [demo](http://gamepadviewer.com/?p=1&css=https://bbb651.github.io/GamepadViewerSkins/GuitarHero5/skin.css)
	I made this for a Youtube video as I haven't found a good program or skin for this task. As of writing this, the skin doesn't include the PS button + dpad, and doesn't include the whammy bar. The buttons also don't fit the "realistic" style, I think I like that style more so I'm probably going to make the other assets match them at some point. Also the skin turned out huge, so you might need to scale it down.
